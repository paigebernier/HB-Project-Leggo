# HB-Project-Leggo

Leggo SF was inspired by the abundance of food and events in SF. 
The app solves the decision paralysis that results from too many options by providing an adventure based on a user's current location and meal preference. 
An adventure consists of one Yum and one Yay. If you aren't delighted by either option, the Swap feature will get a new Yum or Yay.
